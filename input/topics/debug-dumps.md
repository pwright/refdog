# Debug dumps

- The purpose of a debug dump is to package up the details of a site
  so another party can identify and fix a problem.
- A dump is a tarball containing various files with the site details.
- Key elements include site resources and status; component versions,
  config files, and logs; and info about the environment where Skupper
  is running.
- Should we include workloads in the namespace?  Services, deployments, pods?
- .txt file summaries for some things?
- What details about the overall network should we get?
  - Links from other sites?
