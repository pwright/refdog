# Link command

<section>

Display help for link commands and exit.

A link is a site-to-site communication channel. Links serve
as a transport for application connections and requests.  A
set of linked sites constitute a network.

Links are not usually created directly.  Instead, you use a
grant and token to obtain a link.
