# Network concept

<section>

A _network_ is a set of linked sites that hosts a distributed
application.  A Skupper network is also known as an _application
network_ or _virtual application network_ (VAN).

Each network is meant for one distributed application.  This
provides a high level of isolation from other applications and
networks.
