# Access grant concept

<section>

An _access grant_ enables redemption of access tokens.  A remote
site can use a token containing the grant URL and secret code to
obtain a certificate signed by the grant's certificate authority
(CA), within a certain expiration window and for a limited
number of redemptions.
