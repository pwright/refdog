          Permission to redeem access tokens for links to the current
          site.  A remote site can use a token containing the grant
          URL and a secret code to obtain a certificate signed by the
          grant's certificate authority (CA), within a certain
          expiration window and for a limited number of redemptions.

        overview: |
          - A connector targets a workload in the local site (or
            reachable on the local network).
          - A connector forwards connections from matching listeners
            at remote sites to the workload in the local site.
