connector/spec/routingKey:
  name: routingKey
  updatable: true
  related_concepts: [routing key]
  description: |
    The identifier used to route traffic from listeners to
    connectors.  To expose a local workload to a remote site, the
    remote listener and the local connector must have matching
    routing keys.

  description: |
    A Kubernetes label selector for specifying target server pods.

    <!-- The selector that identifies the pods to connect to. -->
    <!-- This uses the compact format with '=' expressions -->
    <!-- Either this or host must be specified -->

    On Kubernetes, you usually want to use this.  As an alternative,
    you can use `host`.
connector/spec/host:
  name: host
  group: frequently-used
  updatable: true
  description: |
    The hostname or IP address of the server.  This is an
    alternative to `selector` for specifying the target server.

    router-to-server communication.  The bundle contains the trusted
    server certificate (usually a CA).  It optionally includes a
    client certificate and key for mutual TLS.

    On Kubernetes, the value is the name of a Secret in the current
    namespace. On Docker, Podman, and Linux, the value is the name of
    a directory under `input/certs/` in the current namespace.

      to the router.
    - `Matched` - There is at least one listener corresponding to
      this connector.
    - `Ready` - The connector is ready to use.  All other conditions
      are true.
