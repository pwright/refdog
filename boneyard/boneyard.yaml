        What does this mean?  I feel a more relatable attribute might

  #       description: |
  #         A point of external access for links from remote sites.  A
  #         LinkAccess configures the router to accept inter-router
  #         links and creates the Kubernetes resources for external

  #           description: |
  #             The name of a Kubernetes secret containing the trusted
  #             server certificate (typically a CA).

  #             It can optionally include a client certificate and key for

  #           description: |
  #             The name of a Kubernetes secret containing a CA for

  #             property is not set, the controller uses `ca` to
  #             generate them.
  #           notes: |
  #             Consider tlsCA.  And "ca" often means "this is what I trust".  This thing has a different meaning.
